            <h2 class="title">Rocket League Season 3</h2>
                <p>
                    Players, start your engines! Rocket League Season 3 is fueled up and ready to roll on April 7! Get ready for the most high-octane season yet. 

                    To properly celebrate the art of auto racing, we had to bring in two legends that practically perfected speed: NASCAR and Formula 1. Both of these titans of the track are racing into Rocket League throughout Season 3 with their own bundles. Check out the first look at the cars in all of their gearhead glory in the Season 3 trailer above, and look out for more info leading up to the release of NASCAR in early May and F1 in mid-May. 
                    
                    Rocket League needed a new car to compete with the redlines of NASCAR and Formula 1, so our engineers have been hard at work in the garage fine tuning and test driving a speed demon of our own. Introducing Tyranno. Get ready to take control of this master of dash with a Dominus hitbox in the Season 3 Rocket Pass. Stay tuned for the full Rocket Pass reveal next week!
                    
                    Prepare to take in the sights and sounds of race day in the newly redesigned DFH Stadium (Circuit). The classic Arena has been outfitted with a track and all the pageantry found trackside during a championship Sunday. DFH Stadium (Circuit) will be added to the Casual and Competitive Playlists, and will be available for Private Matches and Freeplay at the start of Season 3. 
                    
                    Season 3 begins on April 7 following a game update on April 6 at 4 p.m. PDT (11 a.m. UTC) (pending first-party certification). Once the Season begins, new Competitive Tournament Rewards will be introduced, and the new Competitive Season begins. Season 2 Competitive Rewards will be granted shortly after Season 3 goes live. 

                    The countdown to Season 3 has begun. Get ready to hit the gas and speed your way to victory on April 7!

            <h2 class="title">Faze joins Rocket League</h2>
                <p>
                    FaZe Clan has entered Rocket League by picking up The Peeps, a North American team that was long-awaited to sign with an organization. The announcement came with a high-quality trailer just as The Peeps were about to enter a match against Version1, surprising the live audience.

                    The Peeps, consisting of Jirair “Gyro” Papazian, Austin “Ayyjayy” Aebi and Braxton “Allushin” Lagarec, is a long-standing name in the Rocket League Championships Series (RLCS) scene. The group is often associated with Gyro and a mix of various teammates when they play with an unsigned roster. After getting released from the Pittsburgh Knights, it was simply a matter of time before the talented team would be picked up again. It took seven months and a lot of speculation, but FaZe Clan has finally entered Rocket League by signing the top-5 team.
                    Former-Peeps FaZe are currently sitting in fifth place–enough for a world championship spot–should they hold on to it once the split ends in May. The Peeps–then consisting of Gyro, SpaceStation Gaming’s Slater “Retals” Thomas and Team Envy’s Nick “mist” Costello–first blasted onto the Rocket League scene by winning DreamHack Montreal 2019 against all odds. After all, they were unproven newcomers. And thus, the common phrase “Don’t sleep on The Peeps” was born.

                    Since winning their first major, The Peeps have been a constant presence near the top of Rocket League, albeit with different rosters. The current roster formed at the start of the current season of the RLCS, when Gyro and Ayyjayy picked up Allushin. The team has had mixed results this season, but garnered enough points to sit fairly comfortably in the top six.

                    FaZe has entered the RLCS by bringing aboard a team that not only has an existing fanbase within the community, but also one that can perform at the top.

                    “We’ve been talking to FaZe for probably like three weeks and for it to finally happen actually is just insane,” said Gyro with a huge smile on his face in the post-match interview, just after the announcement happened. “I am forever a Peep. If I’m ever not sponsored again, that’s gonna be my go-to name. I own that name.”

            <h2 class="title">Rizzo Retires!</h2>
                <p>
                    Dillon “Rizzo” Rizzo is retiring from professional Rocket League. The G2 player made his announcement recently on Twitter. He will focus on content creation once the current season is over and G2 will try to find a fitting replacement in the meantime.

                    Rizzo has been a staple of the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) since Season 2. He has several North American championships under his belt and a silver medal from the Season 7 World Championships. He is also a popular content creator with 600,000 subscribers on YouTube and nearly that amount on Twitch.
                    
                    From major wins to humorous moments, Rizzo is loved by many in the Rocket League community. His positive attitude combined with his constant presence near the top of the game made him a popular figure and streamer. However, G2’s more recent results have left something to be desired. The community began speculating with increasing frequency whether G2 was making a roster change ahead of the spring split.

                    Rizzo’s stated that his retirement comes from a lack of motivation after over five years of competitive Rocket League. His drive to compete has dwindled too much for him to continue playing with joy. Rizzo’s departure also means the end of the current longest-standing duo in the professional Rocket League scene. He and his teammate, Jacob “Jknaps” Knapman, are currently edging towards 1,500 days together.
